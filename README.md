<pros>: Although the program was long, I felt that I enjoyed this program since it provided great practice for defining methods. 
	
<cons>: I feel that there is a way to define a static method to calculate the total sum of particiular values. I am sure that the static method would have made the program much easier to write. If this static method had been defined, then a method to calculate the annual projection could also be defined.
